# RBL-test-programs
This is the code we used to compare different test programs with different versions of the [RBL Framework](https://github.com/martinzimmermann/RBL-Framework).

## Usage

Execute ```python automation.py``` in the root folder. A CSV file ```result.csv``` will be written in the root folder with all the results.
Important to note is that the Mobile robot examples only work on Windows PC, because the used FMUs were only compiled for that architecture.
